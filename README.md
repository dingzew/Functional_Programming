# Functional_Programming
This repo is the homework solution and learning material from Programming Language Course @ Coursera

1. functional programming with Standard ML, include practice in functional programming style, recursive call, tail recuision, sytactic sugar and pattern matching. Finished
2. functional programming with Racket, include curry function, stream, delayed evaluation, closure in Racket and implement an own interpreter with Racket struct. Finished
3. object oriented programming with Ruby, contrast oop with functional programming and object oriented programming and analyze their own advantage above the others. Haven't started yet but I'm highly expecting that start.
